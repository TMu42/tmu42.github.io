        This website uses the emu as one of its symbols due to its hardy and
        adaptive nature. The emu is an ancient, flightless bird, native to the
        Australian continent; it survives and thrives across arid regions to
        dense forests and everything in between. The emu has also adapted to
        human habitation in all but the most urbanized areas. Emus are tall,
        strong, majestic survivours and are capable of tremendous speed and
        agility. I aim to develop projects which embody these characteristics.
        If my code is robust, agile, adaptable and speedy, I have done a good
        day's work.

        I have great respect for the emu and those who hold it in high esteem.
        I use this symbol out of love and respect. I understand that it holds
        a diverse significance for many people and I hope that I honour the
        emu in the eyes of those people. For more details, please see my
        acknowledgement of the significance of the emu below. It is truely a
        flightless, avian marvel.

        We acknowledge that the emu is a sacred totem for many individuals,
        families, clans and First Nations of Australian Aboriginal heritage.
        Symbolically it may represent a spiritual connection to country or
        indeed have other significance to these people. We express our deepest
        respect for these traditional customs and those who practise them. We
        also acknowledge that the emu is a symbol of national identity for
        Australians with and without Aboriginal heritage. It appears as the
        sinister (left) bearer of the Australian Coat of Arms and is regarded
        by many as the unofficial avian emblem of Australia. It has also
        appeared on a number of coins and stamps. Through our use of the
        <a href="/logos#Emu Logo">Emu Logo</a>, we imply no affiliation with
        any other individual or group which holds this majestic bird as a
        symbol, emblem, totem or cultural icon.
