        In the interest of minimising cultural harm and furthering

        We celebrate diversity of all kinds and hope to foster a culture of
        mutual respect between all peoples. In this interest, we make every
        effort to engage in inclusive and culturally safe publication
        practices. We acknowledge however that we may sometimes make mistakes

        We acknowledge that the emu is a sacred totem for many individuals,
        families, clans and First Nations of Australian Aboriginal heritage.
        Symbolically it may represent a spiritual connection to country or
        indeed have other significance to these people. We express our deepest
        respect for these traditional customs and those who practise them. We
        also acknowledge that the emu is a symbol of national identity for
        Australians with and without Aboriginal heritage. It appears as the
        sinister (left) bearer of the Australian Coat of Arms and is regarded
        by many as the unofficial avian emblem of Australia. It has also
        appeared on a number of coins and stamps. Through our use of the
        <a href="logos.html">Emu Logo</a>, we imply no affiliation with any
        other individual or group which holds this majestic bird as a symbol,
        emblem, totem or cultural icon.
